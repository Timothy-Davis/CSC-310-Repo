# CSC-310-Repo

This repository contains all homeworks I have completed in CSC310, each file contains source codes, a seperate, more specific README, 
and a rationale containing the reasoning behind my programming choices. <br>

This "master" README will label each .zip file in the repository.<br>

**TimothyDavisHW1.zip** - Python programmning pracitce; there are 4 methods that do the following respectively: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1) Reads lines as they are entered, then prints them in reverse order.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   2) Determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in an array of integers whose array is odd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   3) Retern all permutations of a given array of integers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   4) Calculates the Hamming distance between two integers.<br>
**TimothyDavisHW3.zip** - Java program that implements a stack data structure.<br>
**TimothyDavisHW4.zip** - Java program using Linked Lists that implements a queue data structure.<br>
**TimothyDavisHW5.zip** - Java program that recursively completes the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and preforms in-order, post-order, and pre-order tree traversals.<br>
**TimothyDavisHW6.zip** - Java program that implements a priority queue, heapsort, and a binary min-heap.
